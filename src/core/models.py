"""
models.py - Custom user and profile models for the core app

This module defines the custom User model (using email as the unique identifier) and the UserProfile model,
which extends user information and links users to organizations. It also includes a signal receiver to ensure
that deleting a UserProfile deletes the associated User object.

Classes:
- User: Custom user model with email as the unique identifier.
- UserProfile: Profile model linked to User and Organisation, with role flags and a unique slug.

Signals:
- delete_user_on_profile_delete: Deletes the User when the associated UserProfile is deleted.
